## The Waker

The `Waker` type allows for a loose coupling between the reactor-part and the executor-part of a runtime.

By having a wake up mechanism that is _not_ tied to the thing that executes
the future, runtime-implementors can come up with interesting new wake-up
mechanisms. An example of this can be spawning a thread to do some work that
eventually notifies the future, completely independent of the current runtime.

Without a waker, the executor would be the _only_ way to notify a running
task, whereas with the waker, we get a loose coupling where it's easy to
extend the ecosystem with new leaf-level tasks.

## The Context type

As the docs state, as of now this type only wrapps a `Waker`, but it gives some
flexibility for future evolutions of the API in Rust. The context can for example hold
task-local storage and provide space for debugging hooks in later iterations.

## Understanding the `Waker`

One of the most confusing things we encounter when implementing our own `Futures`
is how we implement a `Waker` . Creating a `Waker` involves creating a `vtable`
which allows us to use dynamic dispatch to call methods on a _type erased_ trait
object we construct ourselves.

>If you want to know more about dynamic dispatch in Rust I can recommend  an 
article written by Adam Schwalm called [Exploring Dynamic Dispatch in Rust](https://alschwalm.com/blog/static/2017/03/07/exploring-dynamic-dispatch-in-rust/).

Let's explain this a bit more in detail.

## Fat pointers in Rust

To get a better understanding of how we implement the `Waker` in Rust, we need
to take a step back and talk about some fundamentals. Let's start by taking a
look at the size of some different pointer types in Rust. 

Run the following code _(You'll have to press "play" to see the output)_:

``` rust
# use std::mem::size_of;
trait SomeTrait { }

fn main() {
    println!("======== The size of different pointers in Rust: ========");
    println!("&dyn Trait:-----{}", size_of::<&dyn SomeTrait>());
    println!("&[&dyn Trait]:--{}", size_of::<&[&dyn SomeTrait]>());
    println!("Box<Trait>:-----{}", size_of::<Box<SomeTrait>>());
    println!("&i32:-----------{}", size_of::<&i32>());
    println!("&[i32]:---------{}", size_of::<&[i32]>());
    println!("Box<i32>:-------{}", size_of::<Box<i32>>());
    println!("&Box<i32>:------{}", size_of::<&Box<i32>>());
    println!("[&dyn Trait;4]:-{}", size_of::<[&dyn SomeTrait; 4]>());
    println!("[i32;4]:--------{}", size_of::<[i32; 4]>());
}
```

As you see from the output after running this, the sizes of the references vary.
Many are 8 bytes (which is a pointer size on 64 bit systems), but some are 16
bytes.

The 16 byte sized pointers are called "fat pointers" since they carry extra
information.

**Example `&[i32]` :**

- The first 8 bytes is the actual pointer to the first element in the array (or to the part of an array the slice refers to)
- The second 8 bytes is the length of the slice.

**Example `&dyn SomeTrait`:**

This is the type of fat pointer we'll concern ourselves with going forward.
`&dyn SomeTrait` is a reference to a trait, or what Rust calls a _trait object_.

The layout for a pointer to a _trait object_ looks like this:

- The first 8 bytes points to the `data` for the trait object
- The second 8 bytes points to the `vtable` for the trait object

The reason for this is to allow us to refer to an object we know nothing about
except that it implements the methods defined by our trait. To accomplish this
we use _dynamic dispatch_.

Let's explain this in code instead of words by implementing our own trait
object from these parts:

```rust
// A reference to a trait object is a fat pointer: (data_ptr, vtable_ptr)
trait Test {
    fn add(&self) -> i32;
    fn sub(&self) -> i32;
    fn mul(&self) -> i32;
}

// This will represent our homebrewed fat pointer to a trait object
#[repr(C)]
struct FatPointer<'a> {
    /// A reference is a pointer to an instantiated `Data` instance
    data: &'a mut Data,
    /// Since we need to pass in literal values like length and alignment it's
    /// easiest for us to convert pointers to usize-integers instead of the other way around.
    vtable: *const usize,
}

// This is the data in our trait object. It's just two numbers we want to operate on.
struct Data {
    a: i32,
    b: i32,
}

// ====== function definitions ======
fn add(s: &Data) -> i32 {
    s.a + s.b
}
fn sub(s: &Data) -> i32 {
    s.a - s.b
}
fn mul(s: &Data) -> i32 {
    s.a * s.b
}

fn main() {
    let mut data = Data {a: 3, b: 2};
    // vtable is like a special purpose array of pointer-length types with a fixed
    // format where the three first values have a special meaning like the
    // length of the array is encoded in the array itself as the second value.
    let vtable = vec![
        0,            // pointer to `Drop` (which we're not implementing here)
        6,            // lenght of vtable
        8,            // alignment

        // we need to make sure we add these in the same order as defined in the Trait.
        add as usize, // function pointer - try changing the order of `add`
        sub as usize, // function pointer - and `sub` to see what happens
        mul as usize, // function pointer
    ];

    let fat_pointer = FatPointer { data: &mut data, vtable: vtable.as_ptr()};
    let test = unsafe { std::mem::transmute::<FatPointer, &dyn Test>(fat_pointer) };

    // And voil√°, it's now a trait object we can call methods on
    println!("Add: 3 + 2 = {}", test.add());
    println!("Sub: 3 - 2 = {}", test.sub());
    println!("Mul: 3 * 2 = {}", test.mul());
}
```

Later on, when we implement our own `Waker` we'll actually set up a `vtable`
like we do here. The way we create it is slightly different, but now that you know
how regular trait objects work you will probably recognize what we're doing which
makes it much less mysterious.

## Bonus section

You might wonder why the `Waker` was implemented like this and not just as a
normal trait?

The reason is flexibility. Implementing the Waker the way we do here gives a lot
of flexibility of choosing what memory management scheme to use.

The "normal" way is by using an `Arc` to use reference counting to keep track of when
a `Waker` object can be dropped. However, this is not the only way, you could also
use purely global functions and state, or any other way you wish.

This leaves a lot of options on the table for runtime implementors.
