# Some Background Information

Before we go into the details about Futures in Rust, let's take a quick look
at the alternatives for handling concurrent programming in general and some
pros and cons for each of them.

While we do that we'll also explain some aspects when it comes to concurrency which
will make it easier for us when we dive in to Futures specifically.

## Threads provided by the operating system

Now, one way of accomplishing this is letting the OS take care of everything for
us. We do this by simply spawning a new OS thread for each task we want to
accomplish and write code like we normally would.

The runtime we use to handle concurrency for us is the operating system itself.

**Advantages:**

- Simple
- Easy to use
- Switching between tasks is reasonably fast
- You get parallelism for free

**Drawbacks:**

- OS level threads come with a rather large stack. If you have many tasks
  waiting simultaneously (like you would in a web-server under heavy load) you'll
  run out of memory pretty fast.
- There are a lot of syscalls involved. This can be pretty costly when the number
  of tasks is high.
- The OS has many things it needs to handle. It might not switch back to your
  thread as fast as you'd wish.
- Might not be an option on some systems

**Using OS threads in Rust looks like this:**

```rust
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    println!("So we start the program here!");
    let t1 = thread::spawn(move || {
        thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(200));
        println!("We create tasks which get run when they're finished!");
    });

    let t2 = thread::spawn(move || {
        thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(100));
        println!("We can even chain callbacks...");
        let t3 = thread::spawn(move || {
            thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(50));
            println!("...like this!");
        });
        t3.join().unwrap();
    });
    println!("While our tasks are executing we can do other stuff here.");

    t1.join().unwrap();
    t2.join().unwrap();
}
```

OS threads sure have some pretty big advantages. So why all this talk about
"async" and concurrency in the first place?

First of all. For computers to be [_efficient_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency) they need to multitask. Once you
start to look under the covers (like [how an operating system works](https://os.phil-opp.com/async-await/))
you'll see concurrency everywhere. It's very fundamental in everything we do.

Secondly, we have the web. 

Webservers are all about I/O and handling small tasks
(requests). When the number of small tasks is large it's not a good fit for OS
threads as of today because of the memory they require and the overhead involved
when creating new threads. 

This gets even more problematic when the load is variable which means the current number of tasks a
program has at any point in time is unpredictable. That's why you'll see so many async web
frameworks and database drivers today.

However, for a huge number of problems, standard OS threads will often be the
right solution. So, just think twice about your problem before you reach for an
async library.

Now, let's look at some other options for multitasking. They all have in common
that they implement a way to do multitasking by having a "userland"
runtime:

## Green threads

Green threads use the same mechanism as an OS does by creating a thread for
each task, setting up a stack, save the CPU's state and jump from one
task (thread) to another by doing a "context switch".

We yield control to the scheduler (which is a central part of the runtime in
such a system) which then continues running a different task.

Rust had green threads once, but they were removed before it hit 1.0. The state
of execution is stored in each stack so in such a solution there would be no
need for `async`, `await`, `Futures` or `Pin`. 

**The typical flow looks like this:**

1. Run some non-blocking code
2. Make a blocking call to some external resource
3. CPU jumps to the "main" thread which schedules a different thread to run and
   "jumps" to that stack
4. Run some non-blocking code on the new thread until a new blocking call or the
   task is finished
5. "jumps" back to the "main" thread, schedule a new thread which is ready to make
progress and jump to that.

These "jumps" are know as **context switches**. Your OS is doing it many times each
second as you read this.

**Advantages:**

1. Simple to use. The code will look like it does when using OS threads.
2. A "context switch" is reasonably fast
3. Each stack only gets a little memory to start with so you can have hundred of
   thousands of green threads running.
4. It's easy to incorporate [_preemtion_](https://cfsamson.gitbook.io/green-threads-explained-in-200-lines-of-rust/green-threads#preemptive-multitasking)
   which puts a lot of control in the hands of the runtime implementors.

**Drawbacks:**

1. The stacks might need to grow. Solving this is not easy and will have a cost.
2. You need to save all the CPU state on every switch
3. It's not a _zero cost abstraction_ (Rust had green threads early on and this
   was one of the reasons they were removed).
4. Complicated to implement correctly if you want to support many different
   platforms.

A green threads example could look something like this:

Still hanging in there? Good. Don't get frustrated if the code above is
difficult to understand. If I hadn't written it myself I would probably feel
the same. You can always go back and read the book which explains it later.

## Callback based approaches

You probably already know what we're going to talk about in the next paragraphs
from Javascript which I assume most know. 

>If your exposure to Javascript callbacks has given you any sorts of PTSD earlier
in life, close your eyes now and scroll down for 2-3 seconds. You'll find a link
there that takes you to safety.

The whole idea behind a callback based approach is to save a pointer to a set of
instructions we want to run later together with whatever state is needed. In rust this
would be a `closure`. In the example below, we save this information in a `HashMap`
but it's not the only option.

The basic idea of _not_ involving threads as a primary way to achieve concurrency
is the common denominator for the rest of the approaches. Including the one
Rust uses today which we'll soon get to.

**Advantages:**

- Easy to implement in most languages
- No context switching
- Relatively low memory overhead (in most cases)

**Drawbacks:**

- Each task must save the state it needs for later, the memory usage will grow
  linearly with the number of callbacks in a chain of computations.
- Can be hard to reason about, many people already know this as as "callback hell".
- It's a very different way of writing a program, and will require a substantial
rewrite to go from a "normal" program flow to one that uses a "callback based" flow.
- Sharing state between tasks is a hard problem in Rust using this approach due
  to its ownership model.

An extremely simplified example of a how a callback based approach could look
like is:

```rust
fn program_main() {
    println!("So we start the program here!");
    set_timeout(200, || {
        println!("We create tasks with a callback that runs once the task finished!");
    });
    set_timeout(100, || {
        println!("We can even chain sub-tasks...");
        set_timeout(50, || {
            println!("...like this!");
        })
    });
    println!("While our tasks are executing we can do other stuff instead of waiting.");
}

fn main() {
    RT.with(|rt| rt.run(program_main));
}

use std::sync::mpsc::{channel, Receiver, Sender};
use std::{cell::RefCell, collections::HashMap, thread};

thread_local! {
    static RT: Runtime = Runtime::new();
}

struct Runtime {
    callbacks: RefCell<HashMap<usize, Box<dyn FnOnce() -> ()>>>,
    next_id: RefCell<usize>,
    evt_sender: Sender<usize>,
    evt_reciever: Receiver<usize>,
}

fn set_timeout(ms: u64, cb: impl FnOnce() + 'static) {
    RT.with(|rt| {
        let id = *rt.next_id.borrow();
        *rt.next_id.borrow_mut() += 1;
        rt.callbacks.borrow_mut().insert(id, Box::new(cb));
        let evt_sender = rt.evt_sender.clone();
        thread::spawn(move || {
            thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(ms));
            evt_sender.send(id).unwrap();
        });
    });
}

impl Runtime {
    fn new() -> Self {
        let (evt_sender, evt_reciever) = channel();
        Runtime {
            callbacks: RefCell::new(HashMap::new()),
            next_id: RefCell::new(1),
            evt_sender,
            evt_reciever,
        }
    }

    fn run(&self, program: fn()) {
        program();
        for evt_id in &self.evt_reciever {
            let cb = self.callbacks.borrow_mut().remove(&evt_id).unwrap();
            cb();
            if self.callbacks.borrow().is_empty() {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

We're keeping this super simple, and you might wonder what's the difference
between this approach and the one using OS threads and passing in the callbacks
to the OS threads directly.

The difference is that the callbacks are run on the
same thread using this example. The OS threads we create are basically just used
as timers but could represent any kind of resource that we'll have to wait for.

## From callbacks to promises

You might start to wonder by now, when are we going to talk about Futures?

Well, we're getting there. You see `promises`, `futures` and other names for
deferred computations are often used interchangeably. 

There are formal differences between them but we'll not cover that here but it's
worth explaining `promises` a bit since they're widely known due to being used
in Javascript and have a lot in common with Rust's Futures.

First of all, many languages have a concept of promises but I'll use the ones
from Javascript in the examples below.

Promises are one way to deal with the complexity which comes with a callback
based approach.

Instead of:

```js, ignore
setTimer(200, () => {
  setTimer(100, () => {
    setTimer(50, () => {
      console.log("I'm the last one");
    });
  });
});
```

We can to this:

```js, ignore
function timer(ms) {
    return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms))
}

timer(200)
.then(() => return timer(100))
.then(() => return timer(50))
.then(() => console.log("I'm the last one));
```

The change is even more substantial under the hood. You see, promises return
a state machine which can be in one of three states: `pending`, `fulfilled` or 
`rejected`. 

When we call `timer(200)` in the sample above, we get back a promise in the state `pending`.

Since promises are re-written as state machines they also enable an even better
syntax which allows us to write our last example like this:

```js, ignore
async function run() {
    await timer(200);
    await timer(100);
    await timer(50);
    console.log("I'm the last one");
}
```

You can consider the `run` function a _pausable_ task consisting of several
sub-tasks. On each "await" point it yields control to the scheduler (in this
case it's the well known Javascript event loop). 

Once one of the sub-tasks changes state to either `fulfilled` or `rejected` the
task is scheduled to continue to the next step.

Syntactically, Rusts Futures 0.1 was a lot like the promises example above and
Rusts Futures 0.3 is a lot like async/await in our last example.

Now this is also where the similarities with Rust's Futures stop. The reason we 
go through all this is to get an introduction and get into the right mindset for
exploring Rust's Futures.

> To avoid confusion later on: There's one difference you should know. Javascript
> promises are _eagerly_ evaluated. That means that once it's created, it starts
> running a task. Rusts Futures on the other hand is _lazily_ evaluated. They
> need to be polled once before they do any work.
